There is high demand for the product in Lagos, Ibadan, Abeokuta and other surrounding cities.</p><p>The cost of the machinery required for the crushing of the granite make up between 60 and 70 per cent of the cost of establishing the business and is dependent on site being opened. To achieve maximum productivity and reduce costs, the plant must be located close to the area where the stones are extracted.</p><p>The three basic steps involved in quarrying are extraction, crushing and grinding. Some of the equipment needed include crushers, excavators, dumpers, pay loaders, generators, and conveyor belts.</p><p>Before the installation of any machinery, it is important to ensure that a comprehensive assessment of the quarry site has been carried out to ensure the availability of necessary resources and safety of workers on site.</p><p>Setting up a quarry plant is not an easy task as it involves extensive excavation, hauling of suitable rocks and stones to a crushing site, plus the processing to the finished product.
