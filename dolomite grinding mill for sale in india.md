In the crushing stage, large block dolomite extracted from the mine is crushed into small particles with a diameter of 40mm by a crusher. The crushed dolomite particles are sent to the storage hopper by the elevator, and then sent to the grinding chamber of the mill evenly and quantitatively by the vibrating feeder for grinding.</p><p>In the grinding stage, the dolomite particles are ground to a certain fineness by the grinding mill. The grinding process is divided into three steps: crushing, grinding, and grading.
