Over the years, our impact crushers have been exported to many countries and regions around the world, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, etc.</p><p>When it comes to the price of impact crushers, it is necessary to understand that the price usually reflects the quality and performance of the equipment. Different manufacturers offer different quotation methods, such as direct sales and dealership sales.

For example, the PF-1007 impact crusher, a small-scale product, has a price lower than $10,000, while the PF-1520 impact crusher, a large-scale product, has a price higher than $100,000.
