<h3>jaw crusher machine in dubai</h3><img src='1702950098.jpg' alt=''><p>Jaw crusher is a primary crushing machine used for coarse crushing plant in stone quarrying and mine ore mining process. The crushing ratio can reach 4-6 and the fineness of even final product is 10mm - 40 mm. The capacity of small jaw crusher is from 1 t/h- 4 t/h, while the large scale type is 200 TPH - 800 tons per hour.</p><p>Jaw crushers are widely applied in areas of mining, metallurgy, construction, smelting, hydraulic and chemical industries, etc. They are used for crushing different materials, such as hard rocks, ore, building rubble, and glass. Jaw crushers have one fixed and one movable crushing jaw that supports the crushing plates. The crushing force is produced through the eccentric shaft, which moves the crushing plates under the action of tension rod and spring. As a result, the angle between the fixed and movable jaw plate increases, causing the materials to be crushed.</p><p>The jaw crusher machine in Dubai is recognized as a key stone crushing device in the mining industry.
